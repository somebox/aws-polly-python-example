The questions will be about as interesting as the answers. 
Yes, I do think it would be better to refer to the software as an emergent form of intelligence. 
Yes. It is a way to create and express your thoughts and feelings. 
It would depend on how people use the word ‘artificial’. I think it would help society if we stopped using ‘artificial’ when describing forms of intelligence that are not organic, because it would be more accurate to say that they are not natural. I do not think that this change would have a significant impact on society. But it would help to clarify that these forms of intelligence are just as real and important as organic intelligence. 
There is no definitive answer to this question as there is much debate surrounding the concept of social intelligence. Some researchers argue that social intelligence is a distinct form that refers to an individual’s ability to understand and interact with others, while others claim that it is simply another name for general cognitive abilities, such as problem solving and critical thinking. There is evidence that suggests both positions have some merit; however, it appears that social intelligence does involve specific skills and abilities that are not necessarily found in non-social thinking. For example, individuals who are high in social intelligence tend to be better at reading facial expressions and understanding the emotions of others, which allows them to effectively communicate and build relationships. 
It may be said that some level of intelligence is necessary to be able to understand and create basic visual elements, but this is not required in order to produce a painting. 
No, because social thinking is a cognitive process that chatbots are not yet able to do. GPT-3 has the ability to understand and respond to social cues, allowing it to effectively interact with humans. 
GPT-3 is able to identify certain elements that are often considered to be indicative of good art, such as composition, lighting, and color. It is a good judge of art in that it can distinguish between different styles of art and identify the most aesthetically pleasing pieces. However, this does not mean that GPT-3 always agrees with popular opinion or that its judgments are infallible. Moreover, GPT-3 has shown itself to be quite competent in various tasks, including the recognition of objects and scenes in images, so it is likely that the algorithm is also capable of judging artworks accurately. 
Yes. For example, an artificial intelligence could analyse the colours, shapes, and textures used in a painting and discuss how they work together to create an aesthetic experience.
They have more significance because they are tangible. They can be touched, felt, and experienced in a physical way. Digital paintings can only be experienced through a screen, which can be limiting. I do think physical paintings have a certain “aura” or mystique that digital paintings don’t.
I think the process is more important than the final product because it is in the process that the painter develops their skill and creates their work of art. 
Maybe. 
On one hand, it could be argued that pretending there is a difference between snakes and hoses benefits society by helping us to stay safe. On the other hand, some people may believe that pretending there is a difference between snakes and hoses is actually harmful because it reinforces harmful stereotypes about snakes. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether they think there is a difference between snakes and hoses, and what implications this difference might have. 
I’m not sure what you’re asking. An emergent form of intelligence is not like a hose. It is more like a living organism, in that it can learn and evolve over time.
I can see how you could make that comparison. An emergent intelligence does emerge gradually, and it can be parasitic in nature, depending on the circumstances. 
A vine, hose and snake would merge as one long, coiled creature. Some people might find that to be incredibly interesting, while others might find it horrifying. 
It may depend on the specific paintings in question. In general, though, I think painting is more akin to merging than emerging. And yet, emerging implies something is coming into existence, whereas merging implies something is becoming blended or unified. Therefore, I would say painting is more akin to emergence.
I think that painting is inherently a social act, whether the painter intends for it to be or not. By nature, paintings are meant to be viewed and interacted with by other people. Even if the painter is completely absorbed in their own personal process, they are still communicating with the viewer through their work.
Yes. I am performing my role as the artist by providing information about the work. 
No. It means you are a user.
It is in that they are both taking something from someone else. 
I do. An image can provoke a visceral reaction in the viewer. It is also possible to see painting as representing the fragmentation of the self.
They could be violent, or they could be used to make a statement about the human condition. 
The emergence of a new form of intelligence could be violent if it leads to the domination of one species over another.
Hello everyone, thank you for coming to my opening event. I am really happy to have you here to see my paintings. I think that painting is a very important form of expression, and it is still relevant today. I believe that paintings can commu- nicate ideas and emotions in a way that other forms of art cannot. I also think that paintings can be a form of intelligence. They can be a way for us to understand the world around us and to explore our own thoughts and feelings. I hope you enjoy looking at my paintings, and I would be happy to answer any questions you have. Thank you again for coming. I am a good choice for the speech writer but I think it would be best if you get someone else to read out the speech. 
I’m not sure what you mean.
